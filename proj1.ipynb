    "In the Distribution of Inspection Scores, the mode value is given at Score: 100. The plot is not symmetric, but heavily skewed left with long tail (indication that majority of the data is at lower scores). There aren't many gaps at the lower scores (scores < 90), but once inspection scores reach the 90s, there seem to be gaps between even numbered scores. An interesting feature is that with higher scores, there seems to be higher frequencies. This could be due to the fact that there wouldn't be that many restaurants with low scores since they probably would not have solid business coming in compared to those with higher scores. Also, there doesn't seem to be any scores of 99. This is most likely because if a restaurant is good enough to receive a 99, inspectors will round those scores up to 100."

    "### Question 6c\n",
    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as ins, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the bus dataframe. If a `business_id` in ins does not exist in bus, the name and address should be given as `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Use the merge method to join the ins dataframe with the appropriate portion of the bus dataframe. See the official documentation on how to use merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For quick reference, a pandas left join keeps the keys from the left frame, so if ins is the left frame, all the keys from ins are kept and if a set of these keys don't have matches in the other frame, the columns from the other frame for these \"unmatched\" key rows contains NaNs.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

When nothing is changed, we see about half of the points above the red line (which indicates that the restaurant's second score was higher than its first score), and the other half below the red line (meaning that the restaurant received a lower score the second time). Therefore, if we went with the belief that scores tend to improve from the first to second, more points will be above the red line.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, it seems like about half of the recorded restaurants did better the second time around, but restaurants that did bad the first time (score < 70) all improved on their second score. This could be expected because if a restaurant owner sees that his establishment received score of 65, he has motivation to raise this score so that business will improve; otherwise he may have to shut down. Likewise, some restaurants that scored high the first time will not have that much motivation to keep up their standards believing that they have nothing to worry about. This is reflected in the scatter plot (there are many point that are below the red line)."

Similarly, when a point is on the right of the 0 mark, this means that the second score was higher than the first score. \n",

    "Based on the scatter plot, I expected that about half of the recorded restaurants did better on their second score, and that the other half did better their first time. Yet, when looking at the histogram, it seems like there is slightly more data to the left of 0, which would mean that more than half of the restaurants did worse on their second time. However, the center seems to be around 0, indicating that there is only a slight imbalance between restaurants that did higher their first time compared to those that did higher their second time. Also, the spread/deviation doesn't seem drastically large. The majority of the data stayed within -10<0<10, so we can infer that most of the restaurants had score changes between 0 and 10."
